We are using a submodule for the samples directory.

In order to properly clone this git repository, you will have to run the following commands:

git clone git://github.com/dhiltonp/hexbright.git
cd hexbright
git submodule init
git submodule update

Every time you want to update the samples directory, you'll have to re-run the update, in addition to git pull:

git pull              # update the main project
git submodule update  # update the samples directory
