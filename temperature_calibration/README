This program is to aid in calibrating your temperature sensor.


 - Finding your sensor calibration:

Upload the program to your flashlight.

Find 0 C:
Put your flashlight in a water glass.  Surround the light with ice.  Add cold water.  Wait 20 minutes, or until the reading stabilizes.  Record the reading.

Find a second temperature:
Put your flashlight in a thermos.  Fill it with lukewarm water (104 fahrenheit or 40 celsius works well).  Measure the temperature with a medical thermometer to verify the temperature is within range.  Wait 20 minutes, and record both the water temperature and the flashlight's reading.


 
 - Reading the temperature:

Read the tail cap LEDs, as follows:

left most number of digits (first color), 
slight pause,
next left most number of digits (second color),
...
right-most number of digits (first color),
2 second pause

for example: 2 green flashes, 6 red flashes, 3 green flashes = 263



 - Updating your calibration

If you are using my code, you will want to modify the constants in get_celsius to report the correct temperature.  Then go to loop() and uncomment the line that contains get_fahrenheit().  Event_loop also uses the same code.


If you just want to set the max temperature for your light, do the following:
max_sensor_reading = desired_temp * (2nd_temp_reading - 0C_temp_reading) / 2nd_temp + 0C_temp_reading

50C/120F isn't a bad limit.  Do not go over 70C/160F.  I wouldn't go over 60C/140.
