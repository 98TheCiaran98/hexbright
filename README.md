hexbright
=========

This is the easiest way to get started with programming your hexbright.

To use, download this folder, open the arduino ide, and click on 'File'->'Preferences' in the menu.
Set your sketchbook location to the location of this folder (where this README file is found).  

Restart arduino.

Now, click on 'Tools'->'Board'->'Hexbright' as your device type.
With your hexbright unplugged, go to 'Tools'->'Serial Port' and look at the options.
Now plug in your hexbright and go to 'Tools'->'Serial Port'.  Select the new option.  (On linux, I have to restart arduino.)
Underneath 'Sketch' and 'Tools', there is an up arrow.  Click on it, go to 'programs', and select 'first'.

You have now opened up a basic, but full-featured example of how to use the hexbright library.  

Enjoy!
